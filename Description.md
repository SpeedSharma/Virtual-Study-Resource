Objective: To design an E-learning web application.

Technical details:
	Technologies used are as follow:
1)	HTML5: HTML5 is the latest version of HTML. Hypertext Mark-up Language (HTML) is the standard mark-up language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. It is used to design the structure of any website.
2)	SCSS: SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a CSS pre-processor that lets you use variables, mathematical operations, mixins, loops, functions, imports, and other interesting functionalities that make writing CSS much more powerful. 
3)	Material UI: A popular React UI Framework. Material-UI provides an optional CSS Baseline component. It fixes some inconsistencies across browsers and devices while providing slightly more opinionated resets to common HTML elements.
4)	ES6 JavaScript: ES6 refers to version 6 of the ECMA Script programming language. It is a major enhancement to the JavaScript language, and adds many more features intended to make large-scale software development easier. To put things simply, JavaScript is an object orient programming language designed to make web development easier and more attractive. In most cases, JavaScript is used to create responsive, interactive elements for web pages, enhancing the user experience.
5)	React: React is a JavaScript library (not a framework) that creates user interfaces (UIs) in a predictable and efficient way using declarative code. You can use it to help build single page applications and mobile apps, or to build complex apps if you utilise it with other libraries.
6)	Node: Node is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature. It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services, but was designed with real-time, push-based architectures in mind.

	Database/ Hoisting Technologies:
1)	Firebase: Firebase is a backend platform for building Web, Android and IOS applications. It offers real time database, different APIs, multiple authentication types and hosting platform.
2)	Django: Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel.

	System Specification:
                          Processor: 3.3 GHz or faster 64-bit dual core processor with SSE2 instruction set
                          Memory: 4-GB RAM or more
                          Display: Super VGA with a resolution of 1024 x 768
                          
Innovativeness & Usefulness:
The idea for building and E-learning platform comes to my mind when I find difficulty in learning through other learning platform. So, I decided to build my on E-learning Platform as I am Student that’s why I am very much aware about the difficulties that I faced and how I can make this platform a better place for E-learning in future.
Now If I talk about the usefulness of this platform, then I can say that this platform consist of certain features are mentioned below:
	Video Chat and Screen Sharing functionality.
	Teacher and Student Panel.
	Discussion Page (WhatsApp like Messenger with Google Login)
	E-Library.
	Exam Portal
	Online Courses
	Chat bot (Siri or Google Like Assistant) 

Current Status of Development: 
1) Building the prototype model.
2) Done With Landing Page.
